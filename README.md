Hi, thank you for reading this readme file :)
The main file for this reposetory is the search_fronted file.
the search_frontend use all the other file exluding those who made for reasrch perpeses only
for example model_generator that helped creting a mock for running in gcp.
There are also some test files that the search frontend dont use.
The main role of this reposetory is to keep things simple!
Every class except the main one is short in order to help people to understand the code more clearly.
The engine is working by the Boolean model on the body and the titles, make some intersections and sort by pageRank, page views and boolean score.
Hope you like my reposetory :)
